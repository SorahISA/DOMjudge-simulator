# DOMjudge Simulator

Currently, the following basicially do nothing:
- Problemset
- Print
- Enable Notifications
- Logout

## How to use?

Click the top-left "DOMjudge" and its the main page.

Try import the example/nwerc18.json file as contest data.

After that, set your team name, affiliation, start time, and wait until contest start.

(If you modify anything during your virtual, the scoreboard might broke.)

You should use vjudge or QOJ or some other judge to submit your code, and you can record your submission via the green submit button top-right.

(Note that this simulator does not judge your submission. You have to set the result manually in the submission list.)
(Note that a compiler-error still count towards penalty.)

You shall see yourself on the scoreboard!

## TODO

- Connect with some vjudge thing to submit
- Add links via json to the problem pdf and sample zip
- Add resolver
- Clean up the files
- Fix highlighting
- Remove submissions
- ...and many more
